## **CrimeRateAnalysis**

This repository contains backupfor my contribution towards the project-SAHAYAK


### **About the Project**

**Aim** – To provide a web application which can connect people to police or law enforcement officers. 

**Objective** – Security and crime related issues have become rampant in most urban areas across the world. In today’s era where there is everything available online. So when it comes to public and police assistance we lack technology. We don't have any website or application which can connect people to police or law enforcement officers. So our objective is to propose responsive web app named SAHAYAK for public and police assistance to report any crime in minutes. 

**Vision** - In this digital world, our vision is to enhance the security and crime services by providing online services to the locals so that they don't have to struggle about registering their complaints, tracking status, seeking updates etc by visiting the police station. This will be achievable by this our project SAHAYAK. 
Not only the locals but also the police so that they can keep a track on the security system of a particular region.
